1. In this game you bounce a ball off a paddle at the bottom hitting different colored blocks on the top of the screen without having the ball fall below the screen. In the first, I have write code, to draw the paddle and the ball, we will be able to control the paddle using the left and the right arrows on the keyboard and also with the help of cursor, we will make the ball moves, and we will also implement the collision detection logic, so when the ball hits a wall it must change the direction.
2. When the ball hit the paddle, the ball should go in a definite direction based on where the ball hit the paddle so the paddle won't act like a wall. which means you can determine where the ball goes when you hit it with the paddle.
3. I was created the bricks in the game, add a collision detection function, when the ball hit a brick, the brick must disappear and then increment the player's score.
The player has only one live, when he loses a changes, we reset the ball position and restart the game and continue playing, if game is over, we show him a game over message, and a "play again" button to play over.
